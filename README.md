# 🏠 Financial Behavior Analysis Based on Lifestyle and Demographics
## 🧾 SQL-Based Financial Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory analysis** of financial behavior using SQL queries executed in **PostgreSQL**. The dataset includes consumer-level financial details such as rent, spending, loan repayment, occupation, and dependent-related information. The goal was to identify trends and behavioral patterns across various demographic and financial segments.

## 📊 Key Findings

### 🔹 Rent Distribution by City Tier
- **Tier 2 cities** exhibit the **highest total rent**.
- **Tier 3 cities** show the **least total rent** contribution.
- The difference in rent may be influenced by urban development, population density, and housing costs.

### 🔹 Spending Habits by Occupation
- **Only slight variations** were observed in average spending across different occupations.
- Among the categories:
  - **Retired individuals** tend to spend the least.
  - Professionals, self-employed individuals, and students showed similar average spending levels.

### 🔹 Loan Repayment Analysis
- **Self-employed individuals** have the **highest average loan repayment**.
- **Students** have the **lowest average loan repayment**, likely due to low or no income sources.

### 🔹 Expense Patterns vs. Dependents
- As the **number of dependents increases**, the **total expense** also **increases**.
- This indicates that financial responsibility scales with family size.

### 🔹 Overspending Check
- **No occupation group** shows signs of **overspending** when comparing income to total expenses.
- Financial behavior appears to be **within sustainable limits** across all demographic groups.
